            variety, such as Honeycrisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong>: Toss the sliced apples with lemon juice 
            to keep them from browning prematurely. </li>

            water. </li>

        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients,

            warmth to the apple pie filling. </li>
    </ul>
